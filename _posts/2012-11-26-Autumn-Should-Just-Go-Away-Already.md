My Thanksgiving was greeted by the lovely sight of my mother back home in the USA and.. dimsum. Boy do I love dimsum. I spent most of my weekend with my friends, just catching up and having an awesome time in San Francisco and our hometown Albany. It was probably a huge mistake to go to San Francisco on Black Friday, but I managed to get past the fact that I could barely walk anywhere without bumping into a million people! It was also worth it because I got to see some interesting things happen. There is usually no shortage of weird events every time I go to SF, but this time around I got to see Scientologists in action (not pictured up there unfortunately) as well as a protest (pictured above). Oh, I also got to finally shop in UNIQLO!! Maybe I'll post some pictures up of my winter attire. 
##All I think about is winter, my favorite season.
