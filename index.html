		<h2>I'm Sharrie and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. </h2>		

		<p>Well, I have some idea - I know I want to learn (everything), and just plain simply <i>live</i>. I've probably spent the last 3 years of my life planning and preparing, only to find myself here, now, disenchanted and on a clearer path with the help of many wise words and a dear college professor. But that's life. We go on journies, many with expectations and others without. We end up in places we have not imagined of, in places less desirable,  and, for the strong (and/or lucky) few, in places we have only dreamed of. It feels as if I'm back to where I was at the beginning - certain uncertainty, dreamless; however, it's not a bad place considering that I've felt more free now than I ever was. It's a new journey, destination unkown. Only now, I've got the most motivation I've had in my whole life despite having nowhere I would want to be. Funny isn't it?

		That's me rambling up there. Here's the stuff I would tell you if you asked me "tell me about yourself" in an interview: I'm a second year undergraduate student at UC Davis studying applied mathematics. I was born and raised in the Bay Area. ...and I'm sorry, none of this stuff actually tells you who I am, which is why I am terrible at answering that question. But, my website will fit that purpose for now - to let me express to you who I am through my writing, photos, and small endeavors while I document my own adventure to nowhere. I've never actually been a writer, evidenced by 3 failed tumblr blogs, but here's to new experiences!

		<p>This is my personal playground and I hope you enjoy your stay.
