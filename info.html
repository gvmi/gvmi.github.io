		<h1>Hello my name is Sharrie</h1>
		I see you've stumbled upon my (tiny) personal web space. I'm a 19 year old math student at UC Davis. I like design, fashion, indie music, coupons, and sarcasm. My best friend is a bunny. The purpose of this website is ... well, I'm not too sure really. Maybe it's a glimpse of my life through my projects and camera lens. Or it's just my small claim of the amazingly vast internet.
