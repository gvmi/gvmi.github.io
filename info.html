		<h1>Hello my name is Sharrie</h1>
		I'm a 19 year old computer science student at UC Davis. I like Minecraft server development, graphic design, UI/UX design, and photography. I also like fashion, indie music, coupons, and sarcasm. I promise that for one day I'll stop dressing up/looking for indie songs/extreme couponing/being sarcastic, and create a proper project showcase page for you all to enjoy, but for now please endure the maddeningly simple website I currently have!

	    Want to recruit me as a super secret agent? (Or for club <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RV8tNaw.png" target="_blank">flyers</a>/t-shirt designs/photography, but that's way less cool). Contact me via email at sharrie.s.chen@gmail.com
