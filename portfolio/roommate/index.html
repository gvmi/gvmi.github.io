		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>This is an app I'm currently working on. It's using the MEAN stack; MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node. See progress here <a href="https://github.com/gvmi/wildfire">@gvmi/wildfire</a> and down below.</p><br/>
		<h1>The Problem</h1>
		<p>We have signs hanging around in our apartment that aren't very pleasant for guests to look at, but are needed to keep track of who needs to do what. They can also fail to push someone to do their task when its their turn (see 1st image: 1st table row annie, and 2nd table row connie; their X's are stacking up because they grew impatient waiting for someone to complete their task). </p><br/>
		<p>We need a solution that can do four things: 1. keep track of turns, 2. make someone do their task, 3. not result in any roommate resentment, and 4. be pretty/not visible to guests.</p><br/>

		<h1>The Solution</h1>
		<p>I mean ideally we should all have perfect communication skills and be super accomodating, but with 7 people (not all of us are close) that's kind of tough. So let's make a functional app (solves #4). It should be able to allow a user to create groups, add members to groups, add categories of tasks, and generate tables where users can mark off their completion (solves #1). There should also be a notification system where a member of a group can press a button to remind the next person up that it's their turn by sending an automated email or text to them (solves #2, #3 because it avoids any personal confrontation).</p><br/>
