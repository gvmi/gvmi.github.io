	<h1>Aegis PVP</h1>
	<p>I created a public Minecraft server in my freshman dorm room in February 2012 that is still running to this day. It is a small player-versus-player community where players join together in different factions and destroy each other! Come join us!

	<h1>Halcyon</h1>
	<p>A friend and I joined forces to create a to-do list Django (python) web application, because everyone's first app must be a to-do list. My friend was the back-end wizard, while I changed some HTML/CSS/jQuery and refreshed the page a few times times.

	<h1>Outages</h1>
	<p>At work, I was tasked with implementing a responsive layout for a Flask (python) web application meant for sending notifications out when a system outage occurs.
