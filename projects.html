	<h1>Aegis PVP Minecraft Server</h1>
	<p>I created a public Minecraft server in my freshman dorm room in February 2012 that is still running to this day. It is a small player-versus-player community where players join together in different factions and destroy each other! Come join us! IP address: play.aegispvp.net</p>
