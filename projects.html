	<h1>Aegis PVP</h1>
	<p>I created a public Minecraft server in my freshman dorm room in February 2012 that lived until November 2013 ("The Update that Changed the World" aka 1.7.2 killed it, ironically). It was a small player-versus-player community where players joined together in different factions and destroyed each other! <br>
